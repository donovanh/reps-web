# Privacy Policy

The Reps application does not collect, use, save or have access to any personal data recorded in the application.

When using the application, data is stored on-device relating to your weekly workout routine (exercise types and level). As you record workouts, the date, exercise type and level are saved on the device.

This data is not transferred to any other location, beyond your device's own iCloud settings or backups.

## Usage monitoring

The application does not contain any tracking or monitoring.

Should this change, this policy will be updated to reflect any data collected, whether any of it is identifiable, and how requests for it to be erased can be handled.
